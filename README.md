## 🚀 Quick Start

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.3.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## 📱 Mobile Performance Checklist

### ✅ CSS Optimizations
- [ ] **Hardware Acceleration**: `transform: translateZ(0)`, `will-change`
- [ ] **Touch Scrolling**: `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
- [ ] **Layout Isolation**: `contain: layout style`
- [ ] **Hover Media Queries**: `@media (hover: hover)` vs `@media (hover: none)`
- [ ] **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first grid system

### ✅ Memory Management
- [ ] **Subscription Cleanup**: `takeUntil(destroy$)` pattern
- [ ] **Observer Cleanup**: `IntersectionObserver.disconnect()`
- [ ] **Effect Management**: Proper Angular signals usage
- [ ] **Memory Leak Testing**: DevTools monitoring

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: `loading="lazy"` for images
- [ ] **Debounced APIs**: `debounceTime(300)` for search
- [ ] **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth UI updates
- [ ] **Efficient Pagination**: Computed signals for data slicing

### ✅ Network Efficiency
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTP error responses
- [ ] **Loading States**: Skeleton screens during API calls
- [ ] **Retry Mechanisms**: User-friendly error recovery
- [ ] **API Optimization**: Prevent duplicate requests

### ✅ UX Best Practices  
- [ ] **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum size
- [ ] **Form Controls**: 16px font to prevent zoom
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Clear loading and error states
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: 2/3/5/6 column layouts
